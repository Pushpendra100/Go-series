/*
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!

Deadlock, in the context of concurrent computing, refers to a situation where a set of processes are all blocked because they're each waiting for a resource
held by another process in the group. Imagine two people holding onto the ends of a jump rope â€“ neither can jump until the other lets go of their end.
